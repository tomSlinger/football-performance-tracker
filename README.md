# TODO
- success page for adding, updating and deleting a game
- delete a game
- add check to update game, make sure game id is valid (code already set in ViewGameController) - just need to add if statement in view
- rewrite view index.php, need to fix layout and conditional layouts for invalid ID's (all code will need reviewing and rewriting for consistency + comments need adding for ending of if statements etc...)
- fix when no GET variable for id is entered for update, view & delete
