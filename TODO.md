# TODO
- rewrite view index.php, need to fix layout and conditional layouts for invalid ID's (all code will need reviewing and rewriting for consistency + comments need adding for ending of if statements etc...)
- Add a check to Update, Delete & View pages to see if the id passed in the $_GET variable is valid - Code is already setup on ViewgameController, just need to add a if statement in the view.
- Review and possibly rewrite of a lot of the view code. Could possibly write a function that display everything I need for the pages that are very similar - will try and see.
